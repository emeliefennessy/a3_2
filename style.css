/* for the planet info, at first I had them overlap each other, but then you couldnt see the other planet as the text box was up. I then had all the text boxes appear below each planet, but that became too crowded. that is why some text boxes are above and some below the planets.
I also think that they ended up spacing out pretty nicley but in order to do this I had to alter the exact location for some of the text boxes.
placing the planet information boxes both above and below the planets ensures that they don't overlap, allowing children to read about each planet without hindrance. This thoughtful arrangement improves the overall usability of the site.*/

If I were to expand the content to include more topics or sections about the solar system, I might need to reevaluate the layout to accommodate additional information.
